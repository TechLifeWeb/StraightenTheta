# StraightenTheta

This batch file loops through all the JPG Theta S pictures you have put into a specific Windows folder and straightens them.

This batch file requires you first install the Hugin photo processing software for Windows. Download that software from here: http://hugin.sourceforge.net/download/
Also required is ExifTool by Phil Harvey which you can get from here: http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/

Additionally, You MUST update the paths that are used on your system. You'll see notes on these changes within the batch file itself.
